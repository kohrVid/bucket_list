# BucketList

We're going to build an app that logs all of the things we want to do before we
die. It'll also teach us a few things about AJAX

## Getting started

1. `rails new bucket_list --skip-turbolinks -T -d postgresql`
2. `cd bucket_list`
3. Configure your database.yml if necessary, and `rake db:create`
4. `git add .`
5. `git commit -m "Setup rails skeleton"`
6. Setup RSpec: https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails
7. `git commit -am "Setup rspec"`
8. Setup Cucumber: https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-rails
9. `git commit -am "Setup cucumber"`
10. `rails s`

## TODO

Import your pivotal stories and we'll go over in class.
